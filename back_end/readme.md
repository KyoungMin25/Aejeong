This is the folder of back_end part. 
// different from branch "back-end"

At the end of the project,
we have to merge this branch into master branch.

SO, I made the file for each part (front/back) and we need to control files
version by version & menu by menu ...

When each team has to be divided into severeal parts,
then make NEW BRANCH to control each part!
